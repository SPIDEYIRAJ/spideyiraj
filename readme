## Local Run Instructions
1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open a terminal in the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   *(Note: Requires Node.js installed)*
2. **Start Server**:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
3. **Access Application**:
   - Open browser to `http://localhost:3000`
   - Click "New Meeting (Host)" to start a room.
   - Share the generated Room ID or URL with viewers.
   - Open a new window (Incognito recommended for local testing) to join as Viewer.
## WebRTC Signaling Explanation
This application uses a standard WebRTC signaling flow via Socket.IO:
1. **Room Creation**: Host creates a unique Room ID (UUID) on the server.
2. **Joining**: Viewers join this room via Socket.IO room logic.
3. **Peer Connection (Star Topology)**:
   - The system effectively uses a Star/Mesh hybrid. 
   - **Host** acts as the broadcaster. When a Viewer joins, the Host initiates a `RTCPeerConnection`.
   - **Offer/Answer**: Host creates an SDP Offer containing media capabilities (Screen Share codec info) and sends it to the specific Viewer via the Server.
   - **Viewer**: Receives the Offer, sets it as Remote Description, generates an SDP Answer, and sends it back.
   - **ICE Candidates**: Both sides exchange Network ICE Candidates to traverse NAT/Firewalls (using Google's public STUN server).
4. **Media Permissions**:
   - **Host**: Uses `getDisplayMedia` merged with `getUserMedia` audio.
   - **Viewer**: Uses `getUserMedia` with `audio: false` (Strict Requirement) to ensure no audio is ever sent.
   - **Renegotiation**: If a Viewer enables their camera, `negotiationneeded` triggers a new Offer/Answer cycle initiated by the Viewer to add the video track to the existing connection.
## Security Features
- **Strict Audio Blocking**: Viewer code explicitly requests `audio: false`.
- **Server Validation**: Host actions (Mute All, Kick) are validated against the socket's role on the server.
- **Role Isolation**: Separate HTML/JS files for Host and Viewer prevent UI tampering to access controls.
